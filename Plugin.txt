Scanner PluginThe code for the plugin was more extensive than I realized. The manual process of adding the code was giving me nothing, not even an error. I tried to read the docs and but it was hard to understand the different ways the plugin could be coded. I added the files plugin.xml, config.xml, and package.json to as mentioned in the github repo, but it still did not seem to work. I followed the installation instructions and IÕm not sure if I missed something or IÕm not understanding this plugin itself.This was a very intensive plugin based on what different people have said on stackflow and other forums. There were answers, but the answers themselves seemed rather different than what I know.
